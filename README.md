### Direction over speed.

...for my amusement, practice and better comprehension.


Hi, I'm Eloisa and I'm a data scientist that loves math & statistics. I've been working on these programs in a daily basis for my personal reference and for my readers. I hope you will enjoy them as much I did when working on them. My favorites ones so far are 11 and 12.
