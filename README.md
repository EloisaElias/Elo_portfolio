## Direction over speed..
#### ..Once the direction is set, full speed is in order

Hi, I'm Eloisa and I'm a data scientist that loves math, python & statistics. Thank you for viewing my portfolio. 

I've been working on these programs in a daily basis for my personal reference and for my readers. I hope you will enjoy them as much I did when working on them. My favorites ones so far are 11 and 12.

...for my amusement, practice and better comprehension.



                                                       Gracias totales
