    "For example, if the mean height in a **population** of 21-year-old men is 1.75 meters, and one randomly chosen man is 1.80 meters tall, then the \"error\" is 0.05 meters; if the randomly chosen man is 1.70 meters tall, then the \"error\" is âˆ’0.05 meters.

The class of p-norms generalizes these two examples and has an abundance of applications in many parts of mathematics, physics, and computer science."
