    "### [Designing Classes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4203163/how-do-i-design-a-class-in-python)\n",

    "### How to design a Class.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Write down the words.** Some people don't and wonder why they have problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expand your set of words into simple statements about what these objects will be doing.** That is to say, write down the various calculations you'll be doing on these things. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Underline the nouns.** Seriously. Some folks debate the value of this, but I find that for first-time OO developers it helps. Underline the nouns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Review the nouns. Generic nouns like \"parameter\" and \"measurement\" need to be replaced with specific, concrete nouns that apply to your problem in your problem domain.** Specifics help clarify the problem. Generics simply elide details.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **For each noun** (\"contact\", \"paw\", \"dog\", etc.) write down **the attributes** of that noun and **the actions** in which that object engages. Don't short-cut this. Every attribute. \"Data Set contains 30 Dogs\" for example is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. For each **attribute,** identify if this is a relationship to a defined noun, or some other kind of \"primitive\" or \"atomic\" data like a string or a float or something irreducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **For each action or operation, you have to identify which noun has the responsibility, and which nouns merely participate.** It's a question of **\"mutability\".** Some objects get **updated,** others don't. Mutable objects must own total responsibility for their mutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. At this point, you can start to transform nouns into class definitions. Some collective nouns are lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets or namedtuples, and you don't need to do very much work. Other classes are more complex, either because of complex derived data or because of some update/mutation which is performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Don't forget to test each class in isolation using unittest.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The following advices (similar to @S.Lott's advice) are from the book, Beginning Python: From Novice to Professional\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write down a description of your problem (what should the problem do?). Underline all the nouns, verbs, and adjectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Go through the nouns, looking for potential classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Go through the verbs, looking for potential methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Go through the adjectives, looking for potential attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Allocate methods and attributes to your classes\n",
    "\n",
    "To refine the class, the book also advises we can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write down (or dream up) a set of use cases --- scenarios of how your program may be used. Try to cover all the functionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Think through every use case step by step, making sure that everything we need is covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Writing out your nouns, verbs, adjectives is a great approach, but some persperctive is to think of class design as asking the question what data should be hidden? \n",
